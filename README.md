# Feature Selection Analysis

Welcome to the **Feature Selection Analysis** repository! In this project, I'll be conducting an analysis using data from a survey that focuses on eating habits and weight. The dataset was provided by Fabio Mendoza Palechor and Alexis de la Hoz Manotas and is available in the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Estimation+of+obesity+levels+based+on+eating+habits+and+physical+condition+).

## Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to evaluate the impact of feature selection techniques on model accuracy. I will be implementing three different wrapper methods for feature selection: sequential forward selection, sequential backward floating selection, and recursive feature elimination. By applying these methods, I aim to identify the subset of features that contribute most significantly to accurate predictions.

## Repository Contents

- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks detailing the step-by-step implementation of feature selection methods and model evaluation.
- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset used for analysis.
- `results/`: Folder containing summarized results, insights, and observations.

## Methodology

1. Implement sequential forward selection to iteratively add features and evaluate model performance.
2. Apply sequential backward floating selection to iteratively remove features and assess model accuracy.
3. Employ recursive feature elimination to recursively prune features and measure impact on model predictions.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/JDOchoa09/feature-selection-analysis.git`
2. Navigate to the repository directory: `cd feature-selection-analysis`
3. Explore the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory for a detailed walkthrough of the analysis.

Feel free to contribute insights, suggestions, or improvements. This repository is a space for collaborative exploration of feature selection methods and their implications on model accuracy.
